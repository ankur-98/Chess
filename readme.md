# Chess Game
This is a simple implementation of the game of chess in Python. It allows two players to take turns making moves on a standard 8x8 chess board until one player is in checkmate.

## Getting Started
To run the game, simply run the game.py file in your Python environment. The game will prompt each player to enter their moves in turn, and will validate the moves to ensure they are legal.

## Game Rules
The game follows standard chess rules, with the exception of en passant and castling. These features may be added in a future version.

## Code Structure
The code is structured into three modules: get_move, make_move, and game. The get_move module handles user input and validation, the make_move module updates the board and checks for checkmate, and the game module ties everything together and runs the game loop.
